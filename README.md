## üìÅ Repository Structure

The solutions are categorized based on the type of problem. Each problem is named with its number and a brief description, making it easy to navigate. Problem descriptions and detailed explanations are provided alongside the solutions.

### Categories:
- [Arrays](./arrays/README.md) - Solutions for array-related problems.
- [Strings](./strings/README.md) - Solutions for string manipulation problems.
- [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic_programming/README.md) - Solutions involving dynamic programming techniques.
- [Linked Lists](./linked_lists/README.md) - Solutions for problems involving linked lists.
- [Trees](./trees/README.md) - Solutions for problems related to trees and graphs.

Each directory contains:
- **Problem Solution File**: The solution to the problem, with clean code and time/space complexity details.
- **Problem Description**: Either within the solution file as a comment or in a separate `.md` file with a problem explanation.
